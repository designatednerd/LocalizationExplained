# LocalizationExplained

Code samples from my 360iDev 2015 talk on localization. Please ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/designatednerd) if you've got any questions!


##Playground

This is a big playground letting you see how the system allows you to use various formatters and things like `NSCalendar` and `NSTimeZone` to affect them. 


##Project

The project shows a few fun things: 

- Using schemes to use RTL and double-length pseudolanguages
- Using schemes to run a non-system language
- How autolayout smartly adapts your layout to RTL
